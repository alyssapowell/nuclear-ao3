# Nuclear AO3 Strategy & Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** September 25, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Email Response Pending ‚Üí Strategic Decision Point  
**Repository:** `/Users/alyssapowell/Documents/projects/otwarchive/nuclear-ao3/`

## üéØ Overall Strategy

### **Mission Statement**
Replace Archive of Our Own's 15-year-old, failing Rails architecture with modern, scalable infrastructure that delivers 10-100x performance improvements while maintaining all functionality beloved by the fanfiction community.

### **Strategic Approach: Dual Path**
1. **Diplomatic Path:** Offer modernization to OTW with gradual, low-risk migration
2. **Nuclear Path:** Build complete replacement platform as independent alternative

**Current Status:** ‚è≥ **Awaiting email response from AO3 development team to determine path**
