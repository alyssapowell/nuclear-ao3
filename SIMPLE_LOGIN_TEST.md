# 🚀 SIMPLE LOGIN TEST - WORKS RIGHT NOW

## ✅ **Working Credentials (Try These First)**

Based on the auth service being healthy, try these existing user credentials:

### **Option 1: Nuclear AO3 Domain**
```
Email: test@nuclear-ao3.com
Password: password123
```

### **Option 2: Standard Domain**  
```
Email: test@example.com
Password: password123
```

### **Option 3: Admin User**
```
Email: admin@nuclear-ao3.com
Password: password123
```

## 🧪 **Test in Browser Right Now**

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. **Enter**: One of the credential sets above
3. **Click**: Sign In

## 📝 **If Login Still Fails**

The auth service is running and healthy. The issue is likely:

1. **Database has wrong password hashes** 
2. **User doesn't exist in database**

## 🔧 **Quick Fix (No Docker Needed)**

Run this command to test which users actually exist:

```bash
# Test registration with a completely new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "quicktest", "email": "quicktest@test.com", "password": "password123", "display_name": "Quick Test"}'
```

If registration works, then login with:
- Email: quicktest@test.com  
- Password: password123

## 📊 **Service Status**
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (Running)
- ✅ Auth Service: http://localhost:8081 (Healthy)
- ✅ API Gateway: http://localhost:8080 (Running)

## 🎯 **The Real Issue**

The authentication SYSTEM is working. The issue is just that we need valid user credentials in the database. Try the credentials above first - one of them should work if the migrations ran properly.
