# Future Media Hosting Strategy Discussion

## Current Status: TABLED
- **AO3 compatibility implemented** âœ…
- **Strategic discussion deferred** for post-launch
- **Priority shifted** to EPUB/export features for OTW demo

## Discussion Points (For Future Reference)

### 1. Community Protection vs. Resource Management
- Fan art preservation vs. infrastructure costs
- Link rot prevention for community creations
- Corporate platform dependency risks

### 2. Infrastructure Philosophy Options
- **Option A:** Gradual self-hosting (fan art priority)
- **Option B:** Full independence (complete autonomy)
- **Option C:** Smart archival (backup system)

### 3. Permission-Aware Media Needs
- Work-level media permissions
- Age verification for mature content
- Community-specific access controls
- Creator control over usage/sharing

### 4. Sustainability Considerations
- Cost projections: $0-1000/month range
- Funding models: donations, premium features, institutional support
- Long-term financial sustainability

### 5. Competitive Differentiation
- "AO3 Plus" positioning
- "True Fan Archive" mission
- Community-controlled content ownership

## Recommended Implementation Phases (Future)
1. **Phase 1:** Fan art protection only
2. **Phase 2:** Permission-aware enhancements
3. **Phase 3:** Full community archive

## Decision Timeline
- **Post-launch review** after initial user feedback
- **OTW consultation** on alignment with organizational values
- **Community input** on desired features vs. acceptable costs
