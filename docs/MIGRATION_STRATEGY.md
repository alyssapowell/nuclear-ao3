# Nuclear AO3 Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a **risk-minimized, gradual migration path** from AO3's current Rails architecture to Nuclear AO3's modern microservices, designed for **OTW adoption** with minimal user disruption.

## 🎯 Migration Philosophy

**Principles:**
- **Zero user-facing downtime** during migration
- **Backwards compatibility** maintained throughout
- **Gradual rollout** with easy rollback options
- **Data integrity** guaranteed at every step
- **Performance improvements** delivered incrementally

## 📋 Migration Phases

### **Phase 1: On-Premises Compatibility (Months 1-2)**
*Prove Nuclear AO3 works on OTW's existing servers*

**Objectives:**
- Deploy Nuclear AO3 containers on existing OTW hardware
- Use MySQL 8.0 for direct compatibility with current AO3 data
- Demonstrate 5-10x resource efficiency improvement
- Validate performance improvements on same hardware

**Technical Tasks:**
```yaml
# Docker Compose deployment on existing OTW servers
# No Kubernetes complexity, respect their operational model
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    volumes:
      - /opt/ao3/mysql:/var/lib/mysql          # Use existing storage
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ao3_nuclear
      MYSQL_USER: ao3_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
    command: >
      --innodb-buffer-pool-size=4G             # Optimize for their server RAM
      --max-connections=200
      --query-cache-size=256M

  auth-service:
    image: nuclear-ao3/auth:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'        # Much more efficient than Rails
          memory: 256M       # vs Rails 2-4GB per process
```

**Hardware Efficiency Demonstration:**
- Same physical servers running both Rails and Nuclear AO3
- Show 8x memory efficiency (Go vs Rails)
- Show 5x CPU efficiency through better caching
- Prove 10x performance improvement on existing hardware

**Success Metrics:**
- Nuclear AO3 handles 100% of read traffic
- <50ms average response times maintained
- Zero data inconsistencies detected
- All existing AO3 features functional

**Rollback Plan:** 
- Traffic routing back to Rails in <5 minutes
- No data migration yet, so zero risk

### **Phase 2: Gradual Service Migration (Months 3-6)**
*Replace Rails services one by one*

**Migration Order:**
1. **Authentication Service** (lowest risk, highest impact)
2. **Search Service** (immediate performance gains)
3. **Read-only Work Service** (bulk of traffic)
4. **Tag Service** (complex relationships)
5. **Write operations** (highest risk, last)

**Authentication Service Migration:**
```bash
# Week 1: Deploy auth service alongside Rails Devise
# Week 2: 10% of logins through Nuclear AO3 JWT
# Week 3: 50% of logins through Nuclear AO3
# Week 4: 100% auth through Nuclear AO3, Devise as backup
```

**Success Metrics per Service:**
- 10x faster response times demonstrated
- 99.9% uptime maintained
- All existing functionality preserved
- User experience improved measurably

### **Phase 3: Database Optimization (Months 7-9)**
*Gradual MySQL → PostgreSQL migration*

**Hybrid Architecture:**
```
Primary MySQL (existing data) ←→ Read Replicas PostgreSQL (new features)
                ↓
        Gradual data migration
                ↓
Primary PostgreSQL ←→ MySQL (legacy backup)
```

**Migration Strategy:**
- **Dual-write pattern** during transition
- **Table-by-table migration** starting with new features
- **Real-time sync validation** between databases
- **Automated rollback** if inconsistencies detected

**New Features on PostgreSQL:**
- Advanced search capabilities
- Real-time notifications
- Enhanced user analytics
- Performance monitoring

### **Phase 4: Full Cutover (Months 10-12)**
*Complete Nuclear AO3 deployment*

**Final Migration:**
- All services running on Nuclear AO3
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- MySQL maintained as emergency backup
- Rails application decommissioned

**Success Metrics:**
- 20x performance improvement achieved
- Zero maintenance downtime
- 50,000+ concurrent users supported
- Infrastructure costs reduced 60%

## 📊 Risk Mitigation

### **Data Safety Measures**

**Continuous Backup Strategy:**
```bash
# Automated backups every 15 minutes during migration
mysqldump --single-transaction --routines --triggers ao3_production | \
  gzip > backups/ao3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql.gz

# PostgreSQL backup with point-in-time recovery
pg_basebackup -D /backup/postgres -Ft -z -P
```

**Data Validation Pipeline:**
```go
// Automated data consistency checks
func validateMigration() {
    mysqlCount := countRecords("mysql://ao3_production/works")  
    pgCount := countRecords("postgres://ao3_nuclear/works")
    
    if mysqlCount != pgCount {
        alert("Data inconsistency detected!")
        triggerRollback()
    }
}
```

### **Traffic Management**

**Gradual Traffic Shifting:**
```nginx
# NGINX configuration for gradual migration
upstream ao3_legacy {
    server rails-app:3000 weight=90;
}

upstream ao3_nuclear {  
    server nuclear-gateway:8080 weight=10;
}

# Gradually increase nuclear weight: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
```

**Feature Flags:**
```go
// Enable features gradually with instant rollback
if featureFlags.IsEnabled("nuclear_auth", userID) {
    return nuclearAuth.Login(ctx, req)
} else {
    return legacyAuth.Login(ctx, req)  
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Service Integration Strategy**

**API Compatibility Layer:**
```go
// Nuclear AO3 provides Rails-compatible endpoints
// GET /works/123 → Nuclear work service
// POST /sessions → Nuclear auth service  
// Maintain exact same JSON response format
```

**Database Schema Compatibility:**
```sql
-- MySQL schema preserved exactly
CREATE TABLE works (
    id int(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Keep MySQL conventions
    title varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    summary text,
    user_id int(11) NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add Nuclear AO3 optimizations
CREATE INDEX idx_works_user_created ON works(user_id, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_works_updated ON works(updated_at);
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_works_search ON works(title, summary);
```

### **Migration Tools**

**Data Migration Pipeline:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# migration-pipeline.sh

# 1. Extract from Rails MySQL
mysqldump --where="created_at > '2024-01-01'" ao3_production works > recent_works.sql

# 2. Transform for Nuclear AO3  
./transform-schema.py recent_works.sql > nuclear_works.sql

# 3. Load into Nuclear AO3
mysql -u ao3_user -p ao3_nuclear < nuclear_works.sql

# 4. Validate data integrity
./validate-migration.sh works

# 5. Update search indexes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/reindex/works
```

**Real-time Sync Service:**
```go
// Ensures data consistency during dual-write period
type SyncService struct {
    mysqlDB *sql.DB
    pgDB    *sql.DB
}

func (s *SyncService) SyncWork(workID int) error {
    // Read from MySQL (source of truth)
    work, err := s.getWorkFromMySQL(workID)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    // Write to PostgreSQL 
    return s.writeWorkToPostgreSQL(work)
}
```

## 📈 Success Metrics & Monitoring

### **Performance Tracking**

**Before/After Comparison Dashboard:**

## 🚨 Contingency Planning

### **Rollback Procedures**

**Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes):**
```bash
# Emergency rollback script
#!/bin/bash
echo "EMERGENCY: Rolling back to Rails AO3"

# 1. Stop Nuclear AO3 traffic
kubectl scale deployment nuclear-gateway --replicas=0

# 2. Route all traffic back to Rails
./update-load-balancer.sh --target=rails --weight=100

# 3. Verify Rails is handling all requests
curl -f https://archiveofourown.org/health || exit 1

echo "Rollback complete. Rails AO3 handling all traffic."
```

**Data Rollback (< 30 minutes):**
```bash
# Restore from point-in-time backup if data issues
./restore-mysql-backup.sh $(date -d '30 minutes ago' +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

### **Communication Plan**

**User Communication:**
- **Advance Notice:** 30 days before each phase
